# 6DOF Aircraft Simulation Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains a 6 Degrees of Freedom (6DOF) aircraft simulation implemented in Python. The simulation models aircraft dynamics including translational and rotational motion in three-dimensional space.

## ⚠️ Project Status: Under Development ⚠️

### Important Notice
**This project is currently under active development and is not yet finished.**
There may be incomplete features, bugs, and ongoing changes to the codebase. Contributions and feedback are welcome as we continue to improve the simulation.

## Features
- 6DOF aircraft dynamics simulation
- Custom aircraft configuration support
- Flight condition modeling
- Modular architecture for easy extension
